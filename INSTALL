This file documents how to build and install TglNG. For the user manual, see
README.

DEPENDENCIES
To build TglNG, the following items are REQUIRED:
- A C++03-compliant C++ compiler (eg, G++)
- Make
If working from a raw Git clone, you additionally need GNU Autotools, as
well as asciidoc.

The following are RECOMMENDED, but TglNG will run without them (albeit with
less functionality):
- The POSIX.1-2001/POSIX.2 glob function (eg, GNU/Linux has this). This is used
  by the internal ls command.
- The 16-bit PCRE library, 8-bit PCRE library, or POSIX.1-2001 regular
  expression library, in that order of preference. These are used by the
  regular expression functions.

BUILDING
If you are building from a raw Git clone, first do
  mkdir -p doc m4
  autoreconf -i

Run the following:
  ./configure
  make

INSTALLING
As root (or with sudo on Ubuntu etc), run
  make install

UNINSTALLING
As root (or with sudo on Ubuntu etc), run
  make uninstall
